# Orocos RTT / ROS Integration Packages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orocos/rtt_ros2_integration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/orocos/rtt_ros2_integration)

## Introduction

This repository contains ROS 2 packages necessary for building [Orocos Real-Time Toolkit (RTT)](https://www.orocos.org)
libraries, plugins, and components to communicate with ROS 2 nodes and to integrate with
higher-level ROS concepts.

## Packages

The packages in this repository provide:

* [**rtt\_ros2**](rtt_ros2) CMake helpers, scripts and launch files to find and use
  Orocos RTT and OCL in an [ament_cmake](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Ament-CMake-Documentation/)
  package and an RTT service plugin to find and import those packages into Orocos.

* [**rtt\_ros2\_idl**](rtt_ros2_idl) Generate RTT typekits from ROS 2 message and service
  definitions specified in the [ROS interface definition language (IDL)](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces/).

* [**rtt\_ros2\_node**](rtt_ros2_node) Instantiate a per-process or per-component
  [ROS 2 node](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes/) from within an
  Orocos deployment.

* [**rtt\_ros2\_topics**](rtt_ros2_topics) Connect Orocos ports to
  [ROS 2 topics](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/) for
  real-time safe inter-process communication.

* [**rtt\_ros2\_params**](rtt_ros2_params) Provides ROS 2 parameters interface to manipulate
  parameters as in [ROS 2 parameters](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Parameters/Understanding-ROS2-Parameters/)
  and load/store them from/to Orocos properties.
